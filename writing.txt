Welcome to WordFrenzy!

Each time, a random 5-letter word will be picked for you to guess.

You're given a total of 5 attempts to guess the hidden word.

The game helps you in the following manner:
- if a letter does not exist, its shaded out
- if a letter exists but isn't in the correct spot, it's shown as yellow
- if a letter exists and matches the correct spot, it's shown as green!

Good Luck!
